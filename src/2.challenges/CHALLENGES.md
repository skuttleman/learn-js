# Challenges

The tests in this section will require you to combine the skills from the previous section to solve hard problems. This will not be easy. Consider the following when you get stuck.

- Try to break the problem into smaller problems that can be solved descretely
- There are many, many, many ways to solve each problem
- Make full use of the internet to search for ways to do things when you get stuck
- Use each test description and its failure message to guide you to a solution
- Don't be afraid to skip over a challenge and come back to it

Good luck.
