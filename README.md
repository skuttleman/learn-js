# Learn JS

This is a repo to learn fundamentals of coding with javascript.

## Install

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/skuttleman/learn-js.git

## Flow

Open the folder `spec/tests`. Go through each sub folder in order (starting with 0). And open each test file in order (starting with 0). When you have no failures, change the next `xdescribe` to `describe` to run the next set. When there are no more `xdescribe` blocks in a test file, move on to the next file/folder.

## Run tests

$ npm test
```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure all tests are passing or pending before moving on to the next set.
